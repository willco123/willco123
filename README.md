### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Will Cowne, I am a self-taught programmer and have been doing so for just over a year.
My main goal is to gain as much skills as possible around web-development, and so far I have been using Javascript, specifically Node & Express to work on the back-end side of things.
I am also looking into using React to delve into the front-end side, however this is mainly for supporting knowledge to aid in the back-end side of web-development which is my main focus.
I am also working on learning cryptopgraphy using Python!
